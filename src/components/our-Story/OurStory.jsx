                                As first-generation college students, we fumbled our way through the confusing world of
                                careers—without connections or quality guidance—relying on trial and error, grit, and a bit
                                of luck that landed us in places that completely transformed our career trajectories.</p>

                            <p className="f-20 lh-30 text-black ltr-4 o-7 fw">
                                Looking back, we realised not everyone shares the same privilege, especially in a country
                                where most people don&apos;t get the luxury of doing the trial &amp; error.</p>

                            <p className="f-20 lh-30 text-black ltr-4 o-7 fw">
                                Today, 700 million people in India are asking themselves the same question: &quot;What should I
                                do with my life?&quot; It&apos;s a story far too common.</p>

                            <p className="f-20 lh-30 text-black ltr-4 o-7 fw">
